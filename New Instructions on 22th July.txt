The project data actually used HMAC-MD5 rather than salted MD5 for hash generation.

For HMAC-MD5, HT=18D9D801539D2CA1EAD17A0EFCCF82A2

For salted MD5, HT=041e4a5704390ffa50d96145b75a60ec

Any one of the implementation will be accepted.



Example: for key=12345678

For HMAC-MD5, HT=C303931CF27270E7039CA140861B0739

For salted MD5, HT=ac702709256a8dddaed62da22fc35f16
